# NBA-Sleeper-Builds
This was a personal project during the Winter holidays, aimed at uncovering NBA players with the historic top true shooting percentage.

## Overview of Findings:

- There are 13 Players who fall into the top 5% in TS%, however these players had very low playing time (shown as usage rate). The dataset has a relatively even distribution of shooters, from poor to exceptional.

- These top true shooters have modest stats as their usage was very low, avergaging less than 10 PPG, RPG, & APG. However, net ratings (on-court impact) vary immensely across just this small group.
